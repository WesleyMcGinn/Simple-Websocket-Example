# Localhost-Document
If you have node.js, you can run server.js and host a document using your computer as the server.  Anyone connected to your router can type on the document, and it will update for everyone.

## How to use:
If you want to setup your computer as a localhost server, just follow the instructions in [instructions.md]().  If you run into any problems or errors along the way, just mention it in [this discussion]().
